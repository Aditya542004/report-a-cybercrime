            <h2>  What is Cyber Crime ? 
            </h2>
            <p> o &nbsp; &nbsp; Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked 
              device or a network.<br>
              o  &nbsp; &nbsp; While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for 
              the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against 
              computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Others use 
              computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images 
              or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both -- i.e., target computers 
              to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other 
              machines and, sometimes, entire networks.<br>
              o  &nbsp; &nbsp; A primary effect of cybercrime is financial. Cybercrime can include 
              many different types of profit-driven criminal activity, 
              including ransomware attacks, email and internet fraud, and identity 
              fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial account, credit card or other 
              payment card information.<br>
              o &nbsp; &nbsp; Cybercriminals may target an individual's private information or 
              corporate data for theft and resale. As many workers settle into remote 
              work routines due to the pandemic, cybercrimes are expected to grow 
              in frequency in 2021, making it especially important to protect backup 
              data.<br></p>

            <h2>  Defining Cyber Crime ? 
            </h2>
            <p> The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) divides cybercrime into three categories:<br> <br>
               crimes in which the computing device is the target -- for example, to gain 
              network access;<br>
               crimes in which the computer is used as a weapon -- for example, to launch 
              a denial-of-service (DoS) attack; and <br>
               crimes in which the computer is used as an accessory to a crime -- for 
              example, using a computer to store illegally obtained data <br>
               The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, to which the U.S. is a 
              signatory, defines cybercrime as a wide range of malicious activities, including 
              the illegal interception of data, system interferences that compromise network 
              integrity and availability, and copyright infringements. <br>
               The necessity of internet connectivity has enabled an increase in the volume 
              and pace of cybercrime activities because the criminal no longer needs to be 
              physically present when committing a crime. The internet's speed, 
              convenience, anonymity and lack of borders make computer-based variations 
              of financial crimes -- such as ransomware, fraud and money laundering, as 
              well as crimes such as stalking and bullying -- easier to carry out. <br>
               Cybercriminal activity may be carried out by individuals or groups with 
              relatively little technical skill, Or by highly organized global criminal groups 
              that may include skilled developers and others with relevant expertise. To 
              further reduce the chances of detection and prosecution, cybercriminals often 
              choose to operate in countries with weak or nonexistent cybercrime laws<br></p>

            <h2>  How is it Works ? 
            </h2>
            <p> Cybercrime attacks can begin wherever there is digital data, opportunity and motive. 
              Cybercriminals include everyone from the lone user engaged in cyberbullying to 
              state-sponsored actors, like China's intelligence services.
              Cybercrimes generally do not occur in a vacuum; they are, in many ways, distributed 
              in nature. That is, cybercriminals typically rely on other actors to complete the crime. 
              This is whether it's the creator of malware using the dark web to sell code, the 
              distributor of illegal pharmaceuticals using cryptocurrency brokers to hold virtual 
              money in escrow or state threat actors relying on technology subcontractors to steal 
              intellectual property (IP).
              Cybercriminals use various attack vectors to carry out their cyberattacks and are 
              constantly seeking new methods and techniques for achieving their goals, while 
              avoiding detection and arrest.
              Cybercriminals often carry out their activities using malware and other types of 
              software, but social engineering is often an important component for executing most 
              types of cybercrime. Phishing emails are another important component to many 
              types of cybercrime but especially so for targeted attacks, like business email 
              compromise (BEC), in which the attacker attempts to impersonate, via email, a 
              business owner in order to convince employees to pay out bogus invoices<br></p>
